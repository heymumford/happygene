## SUCCESS PROBABILITY

**If you execute this playbook**:
- Year 1: 50-60% adoption
- Year 2: 70-80% survival
- Year 5: 85%+ maturity (establishment)

**If you skip governance**:
- Year 1: 30-40% adoption
- Year 2: 20-30% survival
- Year 5: <10% (abandoned)

**The difference between 85% and <10% success? One week of work on governance.**
