POLYGLOT DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOWS: RESEARCH SUMMARY
================================================

Research Date: February 9, 2026
Scope: Python, Java, .NET across TDD, code review, agent-native development, and performance monitoring

---

FIVE CRITICAL FINDINGS

1. TEST-FIRST DISCIPLINE REDUCES INCIDENTS BY 71%
   Source: Uber engineering blog
   Finding: Teams enforcing TDD at merge gates reduced incidents per 1,000 diffs
            from 10 to 3 incidents across 3,000+ microservices
   Implication: Test-first enforcement pays off at scale

2. SINGLE REVIEWER WORKS FOR < 15 ENGINEERS, BREAKS AT 50+
   Source: GitHub/GitLab CODEOWNERS best practices (2025-2026)
   Finding: Auto-merge with 1 approval + CI passing works for small teams
            Two reviewers required for teams 50+ or critical paths
   Implication: Polyglot teams need language-specialist routing (CODEOWNERS)

3. AGENTS REQUIRE EXPLICIT COVERAGE CONSTRAINTS
   Source: PWC Agentic SDLC report (2026)
   Finding: Organizations explicitly require 100% test coverage as constraint
            for AI-generated code; agents don't self-correct coverage gaps
   Implication: Agent-native development = test-first on steroids

4. POLYGLOT COVERAGE MONITORING REQUIRES UNIFIED DASHBOARD
   Source: Codecov, GitHub Actions, HashiCorp (2025)
   Finding: Multiple testing frameworks (pytest, JUnit, xUnit) need unified
            coverage reporting via matrix CI/CD + Codecov aggregation
   Implication: CI/CD matrix testing with Codecov is industry standard

5. PERFORMANCE REGRESSION TESTING MUST BE AUTOMATED
   Source: pytest-benchmark, JMH, BenchmarkDotNet docs
   Finding: Manual performance testing is unreliable; automated baselines
            with > 5% alert thresholds catch regressions early
   Implication: Baseline benchmarks on every commit, integrated with CI/CD

RECOMMENDED ARCHITECTURE FOR HAPPYGENE

Layer 1: Test Infrastructure (Week 1)
  ✓ pytest-benchmark for Python (< 1 microsecond baseline for Linear.compute)
  ✓ JMH for Java (if applicable)
  ✓ BenchmarkDotNet for .NET (if applicable)
  ✓ Coverage.py (Python), JaCoCo (Java), coverlet (.NET)

Layer 2: Code Review Gates (Week 2-3)
  ✓ CODEOWNERS file with language-specialist routing
  ✓ 1 reviewer for standard paths, 2 for critical paths
  ✓ Auto-merge enabled: 1 approval + CI pass + no conflicts
  ✓ 4-hour SLA for review response

Layer 3: Agent-Native Constraints (Week 4)
  ✓ Coverage requirement: 100% on new code (unit + critical)
  ✓ Test templates in .claude/templates/tests/
  ✓ Docstrings specify test boundaries (happy/sad/edge paths)
  ✓ Feature requests include coverage as non-negotiable constraint

Layer 4: Monitoring & Dashboards (Week 5)
  ✓ Codecov aggregation across all languages
  ✓ Benchmark comparison reports on every PR
  ✓ Incident tracking (diffs vs incidents ratio)
  ✓ Weekly metrics reporting (coverage trend, review SLA, auto-merge %)

KEY METRICS TO TRACK (FIRST 90 DAYS)

Coverage Targets:
  Week 1-2: Baseline (measure existing)
  Week 3-4: 75% minimum across all languages
  Week 5-6: 80% minimum (line), 90% (critical)
  Week 7-8: Stability (no regressions > 2%)

Review Metrics:
  4-hour SLA compliance: Target 90%
  Auto-merge rate: Target 60-70% (deps + formatting)
  Time-to-merge: Target < 24 hours (non-blocked PRs)

Incident Metrics:
  Baseline: N incidents per 1,000 diffs
  Target: Reduce by 30% within 90 days (Uber achieved 71%)
  Critical: Zero incidents in critical paths

---

QUICK START (FIRST WEEK)

1. Read best_practices_research.md (30 min)
2. Create pytest-benchmark baseline (30 min)
3. Create CODEOWNERS file (15 min)
4. Enable branch protection (10 min)
5. Deploy CI/CD workflow (45 min)

Total: 2.5 hours to first working gate.
